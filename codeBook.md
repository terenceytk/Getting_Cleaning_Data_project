Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
----------------------------------------

## Tidy Dataset

The primary purpose of this project is to generate two tidy datasets.

The first one is to combine the data collected from test and train sets. The dimension of the first dataset is
10299x68, where the first 2 columns are for Subject and Activity and the remaining 66 columns are measurement mean values
and standard deviation.

The second dataset is a summary of the first dataset. As we have 30 different subject values and 6 different activities,
there are a total of 180 subject+activity combination. The second set is to summarize and calculate the mean value for each of the 66 parameters (details of each will be listed below) for each subject+activity combination, resulting in a 180x68 dimension dataset.


###  Variables Description 

The purpose of this codeBook file basically describes what each variable represents in the tidy dataset generated by run_analysis.R. 

Note: for the following parameters, only mean value and standard deviation measurements are extracted from the UCI repo
features.txt. For the second dataset that shows the mean value of each subject+activity combination, each of the below 
variable name will start with "Avg_", for instance:

    *Avg_tBodyAcc_Mean_X shown in the second dataset will be the average value for the tBodyAcc_Mean_X in the first dataset
